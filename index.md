# Project and sponsor objectives

# Time Box 

**Purpose is to track progress of the project**

| Week # | Due Date | Objectives |
| ---   | ---    | ---    |
| 5 | April 25 | - Watch videos such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVn9OG9nfH0) to familiarize and follow how to use spring security as well as JWT and mySQL. Get vague outline of it working on a repository, essentially, listen to how they teach and then alter to add mroe functionality for future weeks. THis week progress somewhat slow due to Charlie being the only PBLer.|
| 6 | May 2 | - Make sure to finalize understanding of databases and autentication, begin implementing into our own group project. Try to start adding CRUD functionality to the pre existing code that only admins can alter.|
| 7 | May 9| - Incorporate Frontend to show users how authentication was accomplished with Spring Security and base frontend off existing WireFrame for the project. This week will be mostly polishing.|
| 8 | May 16 | - Site will hopefulyl be deployed and be used by all of the other CSA coders for their own projects. This will be a rough approximation of when we will have a fully functional site. |

## Project Description + Ideas
- Login Pages
- Authenticated Pages (only certain people can access)
- Roles (different access hierarchy)
- Database with users
- API (is this how other people can use our database?)


### Project Owner Requirements
- Site with login system connected to a database, usable by others through an API
- Permissions attached to accounts, allowing access to different actions and pages
- Explanation of how to create a permission system to aid others in creating similar systems

### Tangibles
- Login system with database
- Guide to creating authentication system
- Multiple pages, with premissions integrated
