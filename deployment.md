## Deployment and Hosting Plans

We will probably use AWS for deployment. 

Our deployment server needs to be able to have enough storage space to store the many users that may use our database and all their data.

### Site Maintenance

The site will be updated approximately every `1 days`. Updates may include new pages, changes to frontend/backend, etc. The site does not need to be updated for database additions or deletions.
